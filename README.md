1. Goals of the project

Professors more than ever depend on the online resources and tools provided to them. Since so much work is still done remotely struggling students can be easily left unnoticed. To help professors deal with this we decided to add an additional "Report" page to their Canvas that focuses on helping the class and students. Our goal with this is to keep professors connected with the class by providing them easy access information about how the class is doing as a whole and individually.

2. Desired user experience

3. Implementation details

For the main page, we used HTML and CSS to replicate a page that looks like Canvas. 
For the Report feature in particular, we split it into two main parts. 
  a). One page is going to display the graph of the class overall performance (Week vs GPA). The other part of this page is going display the top three topics that the class struggles with the most. The topics will be listed next to the rate in which students miss these types of questions and a button that the professor can use to easily access additional resources for that specific topic.
  b). The other page is going to display the students who are currently struggling in the class. We are going to have their picture on there along with their name, major, struggling topic, and current grade in the class. This way the professor can easily identify which students need the most help since they may not be represented properly in the class averages.

4. Issues encountered, bugs fixed or still present, and future work to be done (every project has them!
