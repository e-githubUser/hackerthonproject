## Goals of the project
Professors more than ever depend on the online resources and tools provided to them. Since so much work is still done remotely struggling students can be easily left unnoticed. To help professors deal with this we decided to add an additional page to their Canvas that focuses on helping the class and students. Our goal with this is to keep professors connected with the class by providing them easy access information about how the class is doing as a whole and individually.

## Desired user experience
The project is designed to help instructors with understanding the overall class performance and which topics students are most struggling with through a newly added "report" feature. The report includes class performance, struggling topics, and struggling students. Instructors would be able to find additional materials next to each struggling topic and the information of students who are struggling in class to better support their learning experiences.  

## Implementation details
For the main page, we used HTML and CSS to replicate a page that looks like Canvas. 
For the report feature in particular, we split it into two main parts: 
- One page is going to display the graph of the class overall performance (Week vs GPA). 
- The other page is going to display the students who are currently struggling in the class. We are going to have their picture on there along with           their name, major, struggling topic, and current grade in the class. 

## Issues encountered, bugs fixed or still present, and future work to be done (every project has them!
The challenge we had was to format each character and element. 
In addition, we are not familar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so we had issues with the syntax.
