# hackerthonproject

1. Goals of the project

2. Desired user experience

3. Implementation details
For the main page, we used HTML and CSS to replicate a page that looks like Canvas. 
For the report feature in particular, we split it into two main parts. 
  a). One page is going to display the graph of the class overall performance (Week vs GPA). 
  b). The other page is going to display the students who are currently struggling in the class. We are going to have their picture on there along with           their name, major, struggling topic, and current grade in the class. 

4. Issues encountered, bugs fixed or still present, and future work to be done (every project has them!
